### Loops
- loops are used to run blocks of code multiple times
- there are two kinds of loops in Python:
    1. while loops
    2. for loops

### While loops
- a while loop runs until the given conditional becomes False
- syntax for writing the while loop:
    1. use the `while` keyword at the beginning of the loop
    2. the keyword should be followed with a correctly written conditional with a colon at the end of it
    3. indented block of code that will run until the loop breaks

An example of the properly written `while` loop:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0:
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
  counter -= 1
print("Happy New Year!")
```

An example of the `while` loop that will trigger an error:

An example of the `while` loop that will run until the program is manually stopped:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0: # the counter never gets changed, causing the conditional to be always True
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
```
