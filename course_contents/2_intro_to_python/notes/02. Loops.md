### Loops
- loops are used to run blocks of code multiple times
- there are two kinds of loops in Python:
    1. while loops
    2. for loops

### `while` loop
- while loop runs an indefinite number of times i.e. while loop runs until the given conditional becomes False
- syntax for writing the while loop:
    1. use the `while` keyword at the beginning of the loop
    2. the keyword should be followed with a correctly written conditional with a colon at the end of it
    3. indented block of code that will run until the loop breaks

An example of the properly written `while` loop:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0:
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
  counter -= 1
print("Happy New Year!")
```

An example of the `while` loop that will run until the program is manually stopped:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0: # the counter never gets changed, causing the conditional to be always True
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
```

### `for` loop
- for loop runs a given number of times
- general syntax for `for` loop is:

```py
for variable in iterable:
    block_of_code
```
- an iterable is an object that can be iterated over e.g. a list
- an object is iterable if it can return the iterator object (more on that in the OOP section)

An example of the `for` loop:

```py
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in numbers:
    print(i)
```

#### `range()` method
- the `range()` method returns a sequence of integers in a given range
- arguments that are passed to the method are:
    1. `start` - an integer marking the start of a sequence
    2. `stop` - an integer marking the end of a sequence. Important - `range()` returns integers up to `stop-1`
    3. `step` - an integer representing the size of the step i.e. the difference between consecutive integers in a sequence
- the numbers are generated by starting from `start` and incrementing it by `step` until `stop-1` is reached
- the only argument that has to be stated explicitly is the `stop`
- if not specified, Python will implicitly set `start` to 0 and `step` to 1

- an example of the `range()` method used in a `for` loop:

```py
for i in range(5): #the range() method can be used to specify number of iterations of a loop
  print(i) #the numbers printed will be: 0,1,2,3,4
```
