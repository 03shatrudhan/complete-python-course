### Loops
- loops are used to run blocks of code multiple times
- there are two kinds of loops in Python:
    1. while loops
    2. for loops

### The `while` loop
- while loop runs an indefinite number of times i.e. while loop runs until the given conditional becomes False
- syntax for writing the while loop:
    1. use the `while` keyword at the beginning of the loop
    2. the keyword should be followed with a correctly written conditional with a colon at the end of it
    3. indented block of code that will run until the loop breaks

An example of the properly written `while` loop:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0:
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
  counter -= 1
print("Happy New Year!")
```

An example of the `while` loop that will run until the program is manually stopped:

```py
counter = 10
while counter > 0: # the counter never gets changed, causing the conditional to be always True
  print(f"{counter} seconds left until New Year!")
```

### The `for` loop
- for loop runs a given number of times
- general syntax for `for` loop is:

```py
for variable in iterable:
    block_of_code
```
- an iterable is an object that can be iterated over e.g. a list
- an object is iterable if it can return the iterator object (more on that in the OOP section)

An example of the `for` loop:

```py
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in numbers:
    print(i)
```

#### The `range()` method
- the `range()` method returns a sequence of integers in a given range
- arguments that are passed to the method are:
    1. `start` - an integer marking the start of a sequence
    2. `stop` - an integer marking the end of a sequence. Important - `range()` returns integers up to `stop-1`
    3. `step` - an integer representing the size of the step i.e. the difference between consecutive integers in a sequence
- the numbers are generated by starting from `start` and incrementing it by `step` until `stop-1` is reached
- the only argument that has to be stated explicitly is the `stop`
- if not specified, Python will implicitly set `start` to 0 and `step` to 1

An example of the `range()` method used in a `for` loop:

```py
for i in range(5): #the range() method can be used to specify number of iterations of a loop
  print(i) #the numbers printed will be: 0,1,2,3,4
```

### The `break` statement
- the `break` statement is used to stop the loop from running when an external condition is reached
- after the loop has been exited - the next line of code after it will be executed

An example of using the `break` statement in the `while` loop:

```py
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  print(counter)
  if counter == 5:
    break #the loop stops running when the counter is equal to 5
  counter += 1
print(f"That's all the numbers from 0 to {counter}!") #after the break, this line is executed
```

### The `continue` statement
- the `continue` statement is used to skip a step in a loop and run the next iteration
- no code after the `continue` statement will be run

An example of the `continue` statement being used in a `for` loop:

```py
for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 == 0: 
        continue #if i is even, it won't be printed out
    print(i)
```

### The `pass` statement
- the `pass` statement is used to ignore a place in a code and continue running as if it doesn't exist
- it is usually used as a placeholder at a place where some code is required from the syntax side, but the code doesn't exist yet

An example of the `pass` statement being used in a `for` loop:

```py
for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 == 0: 
        pass #even if the block is entered nothing will happen because of the pass statement
    print(i)
```

### `else` keyword and `for` loop
- the `else` keyword can be used with `for` loops to check if the loop has finished running without breaking
- if the loop hasn't been stopped by `break` the else block will be entered
- the `else` keyword should be indented by the same number of spaces as `for` loop

An example of using the `else` keyword with a `for` loop:

```py
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i == 10:
        break
else:
    print("The loop didn't break!")
```

An example of how not to use the `else` keyword with a `for` loop if you want to achieve the same goal as above:

```py
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i == 10:
        break
    else:
        print("The loop didn't break!")
```

### Nested loops:
- loops can be used one inside another, be it `for` or `while` loops, you can mix them in any way
- nested loops should be avoided when you aim for lower complexity of a program

An example of nested loops in which the matrix of user entered dimensions is created:

```py
columns = int(input("Enter the number of columns: "))
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
matrix = []
for i in range(columns):
  row = []
  for j in range(rows):
    row.append(0)
  matrix.append(row)
print(matrix)
```
