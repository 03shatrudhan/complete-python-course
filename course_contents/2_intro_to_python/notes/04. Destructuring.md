### Unpacking
- unpacking is used to assign values from a collection to variables in a single statement
- syntax for unpacking:

```py
x, y, z = collection
```

- the collection can be a list, tuple, string, etc.

An example of unpacking a list:

```py
example_list = [1,2,3]
a, b, c = example_list
print(a, b, c)
```

### The `enumerate()` method
- the `enumerate()` method is used to retrieve an object containing both element and its index inside the collection that is being iterated over
- syntax for the `enumerate()` method with unpacking:

```py
for index, element in enumerate(collecion):
    block of code
```

An example of the `enumerate()` method:

```py
collection = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for index, element in enumerate(collection):
    print(f"Index:{index}; Element:{element}")
```

### The `zip()` function
- the `zip()` function is used to combine two iterables into a single one
- new iterable is created by joining i-th element of each iterable until the end of the shorter one is reached
- the `zip()` function returns a `zip` object
- syntax for the `zip()` function:

An example of the `zip()` function used on two lists:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
combined = list(zip(numbers, letters))
print(combined)
```
