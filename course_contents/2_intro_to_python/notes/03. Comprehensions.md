### The list comprehension
- the list comprehension allows us to create a list without manually appending objects or running loops
- the general expression for a list comprehension is:

```py
new_collection = [element for element in collection] 
```

- the `element` variable will take the value of each element from the `collection` variable and be appended to the `new_collection`

An example of a list comprehension:

```py
numbers = [i for i in range(5)]
print(numbers)
```

#### List comprehension with conditionals
- conditionals can be added to list comprehensions to make them more versatile

An example of a list comprehension with a conditional:

```py
numbers = [i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0] #appending even numbers only
print(numbers)
```
