### The list comprehension
- the list comprehension allows us to create a list without manually appending objects or running loops
- the general expression for a list comprehension is:

```py
new_collection = [element for element in collection] 
```

- the `element` variable will take the value of each element from the `collection` variable and be appended to the `new_collection`

An example of a list comprehension:

```py
numbers = [i for i in range(5)]
print(numbers)
```

#### List comprehension with conditionals
- conditionals can be added to list comprehensions to make them more versatile

An example of a list comprehension with a conditional:

```py
numbers = [i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0] #appending even numbers only
print(numbers)
```

### Set comprehension
- set comprehensions follow the same syntax as a list comprehension
- the only difference is that curly brackets are used instead of square brackets

An example of a set comprehension:

```py
collection = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5]
numbers = {i for i in collection}
print(numbers)
```

### Dictionary comprehension
- dictionary comprehensions follow the next syntax:

```py
dictionary = {
    collection_1[i] : collection_2[i]
    for i in collection 
}
```

- the collection_1[i] will be the ith element from the collection_1 variable and it will be the key
- the collection_2[i] will be the ith element from the collection_2 variable and it will be the value

An example of a dictionary comprehension:

```py
friends = ["Rolf", "Dane", "Josh"]
numbers = [1,2,3]
dictionary = {
    friends[i] : numbers[i]
    for i in range(3)
}
print(dictionary)
```
