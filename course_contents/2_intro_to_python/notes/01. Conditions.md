### `if` statement
- the `if` statement is used to check if a conditional is `True`
- syntax for writing the `if` statement:
    1. use the `if` keyword at the beginning of the statement
    2. follow the keyword with the correct conditional
    3. finish the expression with colon 
    4. block of code that will be executed if the statement passes should be indented (usually by 4 spaces)

An example of proper writing of the `if` statement:

```py
friend = "Rolf"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```

Two examples of incorrect writing of the `if` statement:

```py
if name = friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```
```py
if name == friend:
print(f"{name} is a friend")
```

### Compound `if` statement - `elif` keyword
- `elif` keyword is used for chaining multiple if statements
- `elif` block will be entered only if the previous `if`/`elif` block doesn't get entered
- the syntax is the same as with writing the `if` statement, the difference being that the `elif` keyword is used instead of `if`
- `elif` keyword should be indented the same number of times as the previous `if`/`elif` keyword

An example of proper writing of the `if` and `elif` statements:

```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
elif name == relative:
    print(f"{name} is a family member")
```

An example of incorrect writing of the `if` and `elif` statements:

```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
    elif name == relative:
        print(f"{name} is a family member")
```
