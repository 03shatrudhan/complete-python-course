### `if` statement
- the `if` statement is used to check if a conditional is `True`
- syntax for writing the `if` statement:
    1. use the `if` keyword at the beginning of the statement
    2. follow the keyword with the correct conditional
    3. finish the expression with colon 
    4. block of code that will be executed if the statement passes should be indented (usually by 4 spaces)

An example of proper writing of the `if` statement:

```py
friend = "Rolf"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```

Two examples of incorrect writing of the `if` statement:

```py
if name = friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```
```py
if name == friend:
print(f"{name} is a friend")
```
