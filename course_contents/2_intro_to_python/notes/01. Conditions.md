### `if` statement
- the `if` statement is used to check if a conditional is `True`
- syntax for writing the `if` statement:
    1. use the `if` keyword at the beginning of the statement
    2. follow the keyword with a correctly written conditional
    3. finish the expression with colon 
    4. block of code that will be executed if the statement passes - should be indented (usually by 4 spaces)

An example of proper writing of the `if` statement:

```py
friend = "Rolf"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```

Two examples of incorrect writing of the `if` statement:

```py
if name = friend:
    print(f"{name} is a friend")
```
```py
if name == friend:
print(f"{name} is a friend")
```

### Compound `if` statement - `elif` keyword
- `elif` keyword is used for chaining multiple if statements
- `elif` block will be entered only if the previous `if`/`elif` block doesn't get entered
- the syntax is the same as with writing the `if` statement, the difference being that the `elif` keyword is used instead of `if`
- `elif` keyword should be indented the same number of times as the previous `if`/`elif` keyword

An example of proper writing of the `if` and `elif` statements:

```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
elif name == relative:
    print(f"{name} is a family member")
```

An example of incorrect writing of the `if` and `elif` statements:

```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
    elif name == relative:
        print(f"{name} is a family member")
```

### The `else` keyword
- the `else` keyword is used to run a block of code if all the other `if`/`elif` statements have failed before it
- when using the `else` keyword there shouldn't be any condition following it, only the block of code after it
- the syntax for using the `else` keyword is simple:
    1. write the `else` keyword in the same indent as the last `if`/`elif` statement
    2. follow the keyword with colon
    3. indented block of code that will get executed if other statements fail

An example of proper usage of the `else` keyword:

```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
elif name == relative:
    print(f"{name} is a family member")
else:
    print(f"{name} is a stranger")
```

An example of incorrect usage of the `else` keyword:

```py
best_friend = "Rolf"
relative = "Phil"
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name == best_friend:
    print(f"{name} is a best friend")
elif name == relative:
    print(f"{name} is a family member")
    else:
        print(f"{name} is a stranger")
```
