### Variables
- A variable is a symbolic type associated with a value.
- A variable can be named anything, but it has some rules:
    1. It cannot start with an integer
    2. It cannot contain spaces
    3. It can only contain a symbol, which is the underscore

Examples of variable names:
- Correct:
`response`
`top500`
`one_apple`
`first_numbers`
`_usernames`
`_last_`
`current_`


- Wrong:
`top 500`
`one apple`
`1st_numbers`
`^last_`
`$current`
`response#`

### Strings
A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks:
- Single quotes `''`
or
- Double quotes `""`


- Anything surrounded by the quotation marks indicate a string
- Every opening quote must have a closing quote to form a string
- If opening a string with a single quote, the closing quote must be a single quote as well

Examples:
- Correct:

`"This is a sample string using double quotes"`

`'This is a sample string using single quotes'`

`'This is a normal string'`

`'50 + 51'`

- Wrong:

`'This string will end here.' From here the continuation is not a string'`

`'This is a wrong string"`

`"Same as this one'`



### Integers
An integer is a whole number of any length that can be positive or negative, written without a fractional element.

Example:

`-1` `0` `1` `2` `3` `86400`

### Floats
A float is a number that can be positive or negative written with a fractional element.

Example:

`-100.54` `1.0` `59.1` `10.99`

### Booleans
Computers only understand binary â€” `1's` and `0's`.

This way we can determine if a value is `True` or `False`.

Strings, integers and other data types can indicate a boolean value.

Data types representing False bool:
- Empty string: `''`
- Empty list: `[]`
- Zero int: `0`
- Zero float: `'0.0'`

Data types representing True bool:
- A non-empty string: `"This string"`
- A list populated with at least one element: `[100, 55]`
- An integer higher than zero: `1`
- A float of which decimal number is higher than zero: `0.1`

### Lists
- A list is an ordered sequential data type
- A list is used to store multiple elements in one place
- A list is created by a pair of square brackets

`shopping_list = ['cereals', 'milk', 'cherries']`

`midterm_grades = [4, 9, 6, 6]`

- A list can contain different data types

`phone_numbers = ['james', 8067366796]`

- Each element in a list holds a position (index) through which it can be accessed

`shopping_list[0]  # cereals`

`shopping_list[1]  # milk`

`shopping_list[2]  # cherries`

- Elements in a list can be accessed in a range:

`shopping_list[0:2]  # ['cereals', 'milk']`

- If the list is too big to count the elements, the last one can be accessed with a shortcut:
`shopping_list[-1]  # cherries`


- A list can be reversed:

`shopping_list[::-1]  # ['cherries', 'milk', 'cereals']`



### Tuples
- A tuple is very much like a list, however:
  - A tuple is an ordered sequential data type which is **unchangeable**
- A tuple is created by a sequence of elements separated by a comma
- For better readability, it is surrounded by parenthesis

Example:

`shopping_list = 'apples', 'milk', 'cherries'`

`midterm_grades = 4, 9, 6, 6`

`phone_numbers = 'james', 8067366796`

`better_readability = ('with', 'parenthesis')`

### Sets
- A set is an **unordered** sequential data type
- A set's element cannot be accessed by its index
- A set is created by a pair of curly brackets:

`shopping_list = {'apples', 'milk', 'cherries'}`

### Dictionaries
- A dictionary is created by 3 key components:
curly braces, keys and values
- The keys must be a string
- The values can be any other data type

Example:
```
employees = {
    'ID': 16915,
    'name': 'James',
    'department': ['Sales', 'Accounting']
}
```

- A dictionary is accessed by keys as such:
`employees['name']  # 'James'`
